Now, let's assume that the wire was $10k and had been received. It was appearing in the Bank's API, but our code had a bug that was filtering it out as we tried to clean the transaction history. This went on for a week, and we had assumed he wasn't wiring, so we closed the deal without him.

1.) Write an email to Dr. Horrible to explain the situation. What else can we do to help him out?

Hello Dr. Horrible,

Thank you for your patience as we looked into this matter. After some thorough investigation, we’ve come to understand that your investment into company X has indeed successfully taken place. However, due to a technical problem we encountered when filtering and displaying all your transactions, this one in particular was mishandled and thus not considered a valid transaction. Because this transaction was mishandled and it took a week prior to discovery, we closed the deal for company X without you. Our deepest apologies go out for this matter.

In order to further assist you and attempt to make up for this matter, we can either reimburse you your $10k investment or provide you with the ability to invest in a different company of your choosing.

* Note: I’m not sure of the inner working of Angel List and how deals/transactions are closed. Another alternative to help Mr. Horrible out (what a great name), is possibly add him back on the deal even though it had already been closed after discovery of our mishap.
