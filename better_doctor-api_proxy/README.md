# BetterDoctor Platform Engineer Coding Challenge

__Challenge specs__:

Your goal is to create a simple Rails API that proxies the BetterDoctor API. Why? For science! We believe one of best ways to understand how an engineer thinks is to read through their code.

Letâ€™s get down to specifics:

* Implement a single endpoint in a rails api application: `/api/v1/doctors/search?name=<name to search for>`
* The api should be able to search the BetterDoctor API, by name, for a doctor using the 'name' field in the BetterDoctor API.
* Cache any results for a given query. Pass all results for the given query back to the caller. Any given cache record should expire after 30 minutes.
*  Use Rails (4.2 or higher), Ruby (2.2 or higher) and a HTTP framework of your choosing.

## Preliminary

Must be using Ruby v2.2.3.

```shell
$ bundle install
```

```shell
$ bundle exec bin/spring binstub --all
```

To list all API routes:

```shell
$ bundle exec bin/rake api:routes
```

To start the server:

```shell
$ bundle exec bin/rails s
```

To boot into an executable console with all dependencies loaded (loaded with Pry):

```shell
$ bundle exec bin/rails c
```

__Each request that requires an API access key must be passed in a header__: `X-Api-Key`

## API

To search for doctors:

```shell
$ curl -X GET -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/doctors/search?limit=10&location=37.773%2C-122.413%2C100&skip=0&user_location=37.773%2C-122.413
```

The default parameter values are the same as the BetterDoctor public API.

## Tests

To run integration tests:

```shell
$ API_KEY="REDACTED" bundle exec bin/rake spec
```
